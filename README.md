## Business Overview
**NextGen Corp** is a fast-growing technology company focused on delivering innovative hardware and software solutions in a highly competitive market. The organization has established a strong reputation for attracting high-caliber talent and cultivating a collaborative, performance-driven work environment that supports innovation, productivity, and sustainable growth.

## Business Problem 
Despite its continued growth and strong talent base, NextGen Corp is beginning to experience human-resource challenges that pose potential risks to long-term organizational performance. Recent internal indicators point to emerging issues across three key areas:
1. **Employee Turnover**

Variability in employee retention suggests possible dissatisfaction, increased market competition for talent, or internal operational inefficiencies. Without a clear understanding of the underlying drivers and trends, rising turnover may lead to escalating recruitment and onboarding costs, knowledge loss, and productivity gaps.

2. **Performance Variability**

Employee performance levels vary significantly across departments, limiting management’s ability to effectively allocate resources, plan promotions, and identify high-performing or underperforming teams. This lack of visibility reduces confidence in performance-based decision-making.

3. **Salary Disparities**

Concerns have emerged regarding compensation equity among employees in comparable roles. Misalignment between pay, performance, and responsibilities can contribute to reduced morale, disengagement, and increased attrition if left unaddressed.


## Project Objectives
To ensure continued success, NextGen Corp’s HR department must adopt a structured, analytical approach to workforce management. The organization needs reliable insights to:
- **Identify trends and patterns in employee retention and turnover**

Understand which departments face the highest turnover and why
- **Track and evaluate performance consistently across teams**

Highlight hhigh-performing employees, address low performance, and maintain productivity standards
- **Assess the relationship between salary and performance**

Ensure fairness, eliminate unjustified pay gaps, and support employee satisfaction
