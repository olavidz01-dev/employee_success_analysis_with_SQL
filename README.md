## Business Problem 
Despite its continued growth and strong talent base, NextGen Corp is beginning to experience human-resource challenges that pose potential risks to long-term organizational performance. Recent internal indicators point to emerging issues across three key areas:
1. Employee Turnover

Variability in employee retention suggests possible dissatisfaction, increased market competition for talent, or internal operational inefficiencies. Without a clear understanding of the underlying drivers and trends, rising turnover may lead to escalating recruitment and onboarding costs, knowledge loss, and productivity gaps.

2. Performance Variability

Employee performance levels vary significantly across departments, limiting management’s ability to effectively allocate resources, plan promotions, and identify high-performing or underperforming teams. This lack of visibility reduces confidence in performance-based decision-making.

3. Salary Disparities

Concerns have emerged regarding compensation equity among employees in comparable roles. Misalignment between pay, performance, and responsibilities can contribute to reduced morale, disengagement, and increased attrition if left unaddressed.
